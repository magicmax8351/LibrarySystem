# LibrarySystem
My attempt of an implementation of a library system.


Started writing this idea of a library system. Only wrote the backend of the code 
and it will find almost any book with a valid ISBN. I tried this out with my barcode scanner
and it worked super well. Got too lazy and didn't feel like finishing the code so here it sits! 
Might come back to it, but until then it's still a pretty interesting piece of code. I didn't test
it super hard either so it can probably break pretty easily. It's also a reminder of why reCAPTCHA 
is a thing. The first ISBN database I used had me do a reCAPTCHA verification after like three hits 
to the site and I thought I could have my bot click on the box. It didn't work of course because you know, reCAPTCHA.
